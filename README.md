##TASK 2: PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING

In this task, I developed a predictive machine learning model to estimate Total Sales based on fake sales data. The dataset includes fields such as product name, category, price, and quantity. Since the Total Sales column was not originally present, I created it by multiplying price and quantity.

After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I performed feature encoding to convert categorical variables into a machine-readable format. I then split the dataset into training and testing sets.

For the regression task, I used the Random Forest Regressor model to predict total sales. The model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and RÂ² Score, which helped assess how well the model could predict unseen data.

This task demonstrates my ability to:

Handle and preprocess structured data

Engineer target features

Apply machine learning algorithms

Evaluate model performance
